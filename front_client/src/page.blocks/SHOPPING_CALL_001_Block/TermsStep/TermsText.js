                Wellcome does not guarantee that any Reagent(s) will be made
                available to any Requester. All Requests for Reagents made via
                the COVID-19 Protein Portal will be subject to peer review by
                third parties. Only Requests that are deemed scientifically
                feasible by those third parties that have conducted the peer
                review will be considered for approval by Wellcome. The approval
                of a Request and Reagent allocation will be made on the basis of
                the scientific merit, impact and urgency of the Request, and the
                capacity of Providers to deliver the Reagents. Upon such
                approval, Wellcome will attempt to send the relevant Request to
                the relevant Provider(s) as Wellcome determines to be
                appropriate. Wellcome shall not be liable for the acts or
                omissions of any Requester or Provider.

              <p>
                The Requester acknowledges that the CPPC may provide Reagents on
                the basis that the Requester has sufficient resources and
                finances to complete the experiments detailed in their Request.
                If the Requester is repurposing existing grant funding, the
                Requester is expected to contact the relevant grant funder.

              <p>
                The Requester must promptly share with the CPPC any preliminary
                research findings and technical information derived from or in
                connection with the Reagent(s) in such form reasonably required
                as notified from time to time. The Requester acknowledges that
                any such data or information shared with the CPPC may be
                disseminated to other researchers (including third parties that
                do not comprise the CPPC) for the purpose of accelerating
                research and public health impacts and, as such, shall not be

                If a Request is approved, Wellcome will use its reasonable
                endeavours to provide email confirmation of an approved Request
                to the Requester and the contact details of the relevant
                Provider(s) where appropriate. It shall be the responsibility of
                the Requester(s) and Provider(s) to perform any further acts
                required for the supply of the Reagent(s), such as liaising to
                determine further details relating to supply of the Reagent,
                including delivery time and confirmation of shipment, and
                entering into any contractual documentation. Wellcome shall have
                no responsibility in relation to the Reagents, whether to the

                Provider to the UK Shipping Address detailed by the Requester in
                their Request; (ii) Reagents would be sent using a courier
                selected by the Provider, under appropriate conditions for the
                Reagent; and, (iii) shipping costs would be covered by the
                Reagent Provider, unless otherwise specified. All shipments are
                subject to availability, and the Provider may ship in
                instalments.
